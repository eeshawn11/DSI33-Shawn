# General Assembly Data Science Immersive

Showcase of projects completed during the General Assembly Data Science Immersive program, as well as other side projects completed out of interest.

---

> ### [Project 1 - Standardised Test Analysis](https://github.com/eeshawn11/DSI33-Shawn/tree/main/Project1)
>
> An exploratory analysis into SAT 2019 performance in the state of California, United States, to identify districts with the lowest overall student performance so the California Department of Education can recommend programs and better allocate resources to such districts in need.
>
> #### Skills demonstrated:
>
> - Exploratory Data Analysis with `pandas`
> - Data Visualisation with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`


> ### [Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge](https://github.com/eeshawn11/DSI33-Shawn/tree/main/Project2)
> Training and developing a regression model to predict the housing price of a property in Ames, Iowa. Achieved a 84.44% R2 using a Lasso Regression model.
>
> #### Skills demonstrated:
>
> - Feature Engineering and Selection
> - Regression models with `scikit-learn`, e.g. Linear, Lasso, Ridge
> - Utilising machine learning `Pipeline` and `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning


> ### [Project 3 - Web APIs & NLP](https://github.com/eeshawn11/DSI33-Shawn/tree/main/Project3)
> Using NLP to create a classification model that is able to accurately classify a Reddit.com post between two subreddits: r/codingbootcamp and r/csMajors. Achieved an F1-score of 93% and deployed a demonstration web app via [streamlit](https://shawn-nlp-classifier.streamlit.app).
>
> #### Skills demonstrated:
>
> - Data extraction with [Pushshift API](https://github.com/pushshift/api) and `requests`
> - Natural Language Processing using `NLTK` and `RegEx`
> - Vectorisation with `scikit-learn` Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer
> - Classification models with `scikit-learn`, e.g. Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine
> - Python web app deployment with [`Flask`](https://github.com/eeshawn11/DSI33-Shawn/blob/main/Project3/app/app.py) and [`streamlit`](https://shawn-nlp-classifier.streamlit.app)
